[Part I]

[Hook]
Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra

[Bridge]
Run run run, come back for my glory
Bring her back to me
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh
The throne of our queen is empty

[Verse 1]
We'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids, tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls

[Hook]
Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra

[Verse 2]
The jewel of Africa, jewel
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
I found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra

[Outro]
Remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
No more, she lives no more, serpent in her room
No more, he has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra

[Part II]

[Segue]
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl
For now, let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels, catch her
She's headed to the pyramid

[Hook]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

[Verse 1]
Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank but it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a nigga bills paid

[Hook]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid

[Verse 2]
You showed up after work I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga but I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it, ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more

[Hook]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid, that's right
Working at the pyramid tonight, yeah
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

[Guitar Solo: John Mayer]

Frank Ocean’s “Thinkin Bout You” Was Originally Written For Another Artist
About “Pyramids”
This is Frank Ocean’s near 10 minute long tale of the ancient history of the Black woman, and her gradual decline from a Queen in her homeland to her now degrading role in the Western Hemisphere. She is no longer revered but used and abused by men who would have died to protect her honor many centuries ago.

The song makes reference to the historical Cleopatra, who brought dishonor to her country by becoming Marc Antony’s mistress. Marc Antony was a conqueror who wanted Egypt as Roman territory, which is how they crossed paths.

In Ocean’s song he narrates a similar happening with him and his woman. Now that she became a traitor and left him for the enemy, her decision has backfired on her—because she is not an entity of glory and honor anymore, but of dishonor. She is reduced to a common stripper who is now taking care of her man who has no job. It’s almost as if “the king” is paying her back for what she did, because the narrator speaks of his woman stripping to “keep a nigga bills paid.”

But there is still some kind of unhealthy love and devotion to one another because they still stay together, and are a couple so to speak. This song is literally a historical account of the Black man and woman in America and our slow fall from grace. From Gods to dogs, symbolically.

What have the artists said about the song?
I have actual pimps in my family in LA. It was fantasy built off that dynamic … but you can only write what you know to a point.

Where can I watch the music video?
You can watch the video here on Vevo.
